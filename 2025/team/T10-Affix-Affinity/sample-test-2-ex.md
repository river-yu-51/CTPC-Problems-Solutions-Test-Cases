First note that Zvyxa cannot be used as a root since adding any affix brings the total above 40. Additionally, the maximum number of points that can be obtained from prefixes is 5 * 4 = 20. Therefore, zxxWWyx must be used exactly once since neither Abxvyz or Cyzzyx can reach a score of 40 with only prefixes and S = 1. Since all prefixes add an even number of points, Using both Abxvyz and zxxWWyx will always result in an odd total which is impossible. The only option left is to use Cyzzyx as a root and zxxWWyx as a suffix. These add to 30. Finally, the shortest possible way to add the last 10 points from prefixes is to use aZZa once and aBB twice, resulting in a total of length of 23 (one such word is aZZaaBBaBBCyzzyxzxxWWyx).
