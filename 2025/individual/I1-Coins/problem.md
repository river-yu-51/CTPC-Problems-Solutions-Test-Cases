You are given some coins and need to calculate the total number of cents. A penny is worth `1` cent, a nickel is worth `5` cents, a dime is worth `10` cents, a quarter is worth `25` cents, a loonie is worth `100` cents, and a toonie is worth `200` cents. Given the number of each coin that you have, calculate the number of cents that you have.

## Input
The input contains one line with 6 space-separated integers, `P`, `N`, `D`, `Q`, `L`, and `T`, representing the number of pennies, nickels, dimes, quarters, loonies, and toonies, in that order.

## Output
Output one integer: the number of cents that the coins total.
