In this case, losses give more points than wins or draws. The final leaderboard looks like this:

<table>
    <tr>
        <td>Placement</td>
        <td>Team</td>
        <td>Wins</td>
        <td>Draws</td>
        <td>Losses</td>
        <td>Points</td>
        <td>Secondary Score</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>e</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>4</td>
        <td>12</td>
        <td>96</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
