This problem will be similar in difficulty to some of the easiest problems on the 2025 contest. You should be able to complete this problem comfortably to score well on the actual test.

You have some problems in Math class and English class that you need to complete. Both use the addition operator but in different ways.

In Math class, the addition operator means you add two numbers. For example,
`5 + 1 = 6`. However, in English class, the addition operator means you concatenate two words. For example,
`5 + 1 = 51`.

## Input
The first line contains one integer `N`: the number of problems. The next `N` lines contain 3 space-separated entities: a character (either `M` for Math or `E` for English) followed by two positive integers, `m` and `n`: the ones you need to add together.

## Output
Output `N` numbers, each on their own line, where the `k`-th number `(1 ≤ k ≤ N)` corresponds to the answer of the `k`-th problem.
